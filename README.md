# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster [Kaggle Competition]

The biggest reason that led to the loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. There was definitely some luck invoolved in surviving and sinking, we are going to analyze what sorts of people were more likely to survive. 

Using machine learning, we will predict which passengers survived the shipwreck.

### Comparing Models
We will compare different machine learning models in order to evaluate which one is best suited for this type of dataset. 

We will read and clean the data in order for our models to be efficient and successful.
